    \section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
    We now have introduced our novel algorithm and implementation for Constrained Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for nested sampling.



    By drawing concepts from classical mechanics together with Bayesian inference we provide a powerful
    new set of tools which are very effectively applied to lattice field theory.

    Further work can be done in parallelising the C++ implementation to fully take advantage of compute clusters.
    Using auto differentiation will also require further investigation to ensure no pathological behaviour arises for
    complex likelihoods.


    By exploiting gradients we believe it is possible to use this algorithm for a new class of
    Bayesian problems previously inaccessible to machines.
