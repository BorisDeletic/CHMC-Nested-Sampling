Diagonstics logging:
Have some kind of NSInfo type which contains all data on the current NS iteration.
diagnostics file will have param values, point data, ns info, for each iteration.

Next:
Do analysis on diagnostics, see how well reflection rate hopping works etc.

all rejections are from reflection rate rejections - none from metropolis steps. -
update: lots of rejections from points getting stuck and not finding a valid reflection immediately.
lots of 0,1,2 path length points.

when we reject a point, we can resample from a random live point.
this way we can target an acceptance rate such that clusters do not die out.
it looks like points are getting stuck in local minima and causing epsilon to freeze.

Our efforts throughout the section will be facilitated by the fact that
the two-dimensional Landau-Ginzburg model is in the same universality
class as the two-dimensional Ising model. This implies that their critical
exponents are the same; in particular, ν = 1, γ = 7/4
